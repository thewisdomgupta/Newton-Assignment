I have chosen Photography APP as my Project. Because it will be very beneficial in web designing. As in Web designing, all developers require good quality Images so my Photography app has already the availability of the best collections of Photographs.

During web development, developers need Copyright free Images so they can also use the Photographs from my websites for further development.

In this project, I have used HTML & CSS Only. Also, my web app is responsive. To make it responsive I have used grid CSS & Flexbox. Now my website can be easily used on different devices like Mobile, desktops, tablets, etc.
